  <strong>ðŸ§Š Fast and friendly Julia software for simulating the freezing, melting, and horizontal motion of salty ice on CPUs and GPUs.</strong>
</p>


ClimaSeaIce is a library that empowers users to configure and run simulations of sea ice freezing, melting, and horizontal motion on the
large time and spatial scales appropriate for climate modeling.
We support stand-alone simulations of sea ice dynamics as well as simulations coupled to ocean models based on [Oceananigans]().

## [Documentation!](https://clima.github.io/ClimaSeaIceDocumentation/dev/)

Our documentation and source code is a work in progress.
When things have progressed, we'll put an outline here.
